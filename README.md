# Raman-Analysis-for-2D-Materials
A Matlab toolkit that can be used to simultaneously baseline and peak fit Raman spectra for a variety of 2D materials: Graphene, Phosphorene, Molybdenum Disulfide (MoS2), and Tungsten Disulfide (WS2).

For instructions, please see particular subfolders.

Currently available:

1. Graphene

2. Phosphorene (i.e. black phosphorus)

3. Molybdenum Disulfide (i.e. MoS2)

4. Tungsten Disulfide (i.e. WS2)
