# Raman-Analysis-for-2D-Materials
A Matlab toolkit that can be used to simultaneously baseline and peak fit Raman spectra for a variety of 2D materials: Graphene, Phosphorene, Molybdenum Disulfide (MoS2), and Tungsten Disulfide (WS2).

For instructions, please see particular subfolders.

Currently available:

1. Graphene

2. Phosphorene (aka black phosphorus)

3. MoS2
