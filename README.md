# Raman-and-Photoluminescence-Analysis
A Matlab-based toolkit that can be used to baseline and peak fit both Raman and Photoluminescence spectra for a variety of 2D materials (currently graphene, phosphorene, and MoS2).

For instructions, please see particular subfolders.

Currently available:

Graphene - Raman
Phosphorene (aka black phosphorus) - Raman 
MoS2 - Raman
